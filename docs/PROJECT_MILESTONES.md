## 💡 **Key Technical Decisions & Trade-offs**

### **Database Strategy**
- **Decision**: Multi-provider support over single database optimization
- **Rationale**: Flexibility for different deployment environments and BaaS options
- **Trade-off**: Slight complexity increase for maximum deployment flexibility

### **Authentication Architecture**
- **Decision**: HttpOnly cookies over localStorage for JWT storage
- **Rationale**: XSS protection and better security posture
- **Trade-off**: Slightly more complex token refresh but significantly more secure

### **Testing Strategy**
- **Decision**: Conditional database testing with graceful fallbacks
- **Rationale**: Tests should pass even without PostgreSQL setup
- **Trade-off**: More complex test setup for better developer experience

### **Logging Implementation**
- **Decision**: Structured JSON logging with multiple transports
- **Rationale**: Production observability and debugging capabilities
- **Trade-off**: Slightly more verbose logs for comprehensive monitoring

### **Rate Limiting Approach**
- **Decision**: User/IP-based progressive limits over simple global limits
- **Rationale**: Better user experience while preventing abuse
