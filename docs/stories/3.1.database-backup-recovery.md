# Story 3.1: Database Backup and Recovery Procedures

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** production operations team,  
**I want** documented database backup and recovery procedures,  
**So that** data can be protected and restored in case of system failure

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create comprehensive database backup procedures documentation
2. Implement automated backup scripts for PostgreSQL and multi-provider databases
3. Document recovery procedures with step-by-step instructions
4. Test backup and recovery procedures across different database providers
5. Integrate backup monitoring into health check system

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create backup procedures documentation (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Document manual backup procedures for PostgreSQL
  - [ ] Document backup procedures for BaaS providers (Supabase, PlanetScale, Neon, Railway)
  - [ ] Create backup scheduling recommendations
  - [ ] Document backup retention policies and storage requirements
- [ ] Implement automated backup scripts (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create PostgreSQL backup script with compression and timestamping
  - [ ] Create multi-provider backup automation supporting all database types
  - [ ] Implement backup verification and integrity checking
  - [ ] Add environment-specific backup configuration
- [ ] Document recovery procedures (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create step-by-step recovery instructions for each database provider
  - [ ] Document point-in-time recovery procedures
  - [ ] Create disaster recovery runbook with role assignments
  - [ ] Document data migration procedures between providers
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test PostgreSQL backup and restore in development environment
  - [ ] Validate BaaS provider backup/restore capabilities
  - [ ] Test recovery procedures under different failure scenarios
  - [ ] Validate data integrity after recovery operations
- [ ] Integrate with monitoring system (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add backup status to health check endpoints
  - [ ] Create backup failure alerting mechanisms
  - [ ] Monitor backup file sizes and completion times
  - [ ] Add backup metrics to Prometheus endpoint

## Dev Notes

### Current Database Architecture
[Source: ProcessPilot-Brownfield-PRD.md#database-architecture]
- **Multi-Provider Support**: PostgreSQL, Supabase, PlanetScale, Neon, Railway
- **Connection Architecture**: Connection pooling with retry logic and health monitoring
- **Configuration**: Environment-based provider switching via `DB_PROVIDER`

### Existing Infrastructure Context
[Source: architecture.md#multi-provider-database-architecture]
**Database Providers**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Traditional with connection pooling  
- **Supabase**: BaaS with real-time features
- **PlanetScale**: MySQL-compatible with branching
- **Neon**: PostgreSQL with autoscaling
- **Railway**: PostgreSQL managed hosting

### File Locations for Implementation
[Source: ProcessPilot-Brownfield-PRD.md#operations-documentation]
**New Files to Create**:
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md` - Database backup/recovery procedures
- `backend/scripts/backup.sh` - Database backup automation scripts
- `backend/scripts/restore.sh` - Recovery procedure scripts
- `docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md` - Complete disaster recovery runbook

### Health Monitoring Integration
[Source: architecture.md#monitoring-and-observability]
**Integration Points**:
- **Health Endpoints**: Add backup status to `/health/detailed`
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Include backup completion and file size metrics
- **Winston Logging**: Structured logging for backup operations

### Multi-Provider Backup Strategies
[Source: architecture.md#multi-provider-database-support]
**Provider-Specific Approaches**:
- **PostgreSQL**: pg_dump with compression and scheduling
- **Supabase**: Built-in backup features + manual data export
- **PlanetScale**: Branching-based backup + data export
- **Neon**: Point-in-time recovery + logical backups
- **Railway**: Automated backups + manual procedures

### Production Requirements Context
[Source: ProcessPilot-Brownfield-PRD.md#gap-analysis]
- **Current State**: No documented backup/recovery procedures
- **Impact**: High - critical for production operations
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours to document procedures and create scripts
- **Business Value**: Production operational safety and compliance

### Security and Compliance
[Source: ProcessPilot-Brownfield-PRD.md#risk-assessment]
- **Data Loss Risks**: Currently marked as needing backup/recovery procedures
- **Compliance**: Automated audit trails require backup protection
- **Recovery Time Objectives**: Define RTO/RPO for different scenarios

### Environment Integration
[Source: architecture.md#environment-management]
- **Environment Variables**: Backup storage configuration
- **Production vs Development**: Different backup strategies and retention
- **Multi-Environment**: Backup procedures for dev/staging/prod
