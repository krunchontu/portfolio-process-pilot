## Dev Notes

### Current Database Architecture
[Source: ProcessPilot-Brownfield-PRD.md#database-architecture]
- **Multi-Provider Support**: PostgreSQL, Supabase, PlanetScale, Neon, Railway
- **Connection Architecture**: Connection pooling with retry logic and health monitoring
- **Configuration**: Environment-based provider switching via `DB_PROVIDER`

### Existing Infrastructure Context
[Source: architecture.md#multi-provider-database-architecture]
**Database Providers**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Traditional with connection pooling  
- **Supabase**: BaaS with real-time features
- **PlanetScale**: MySQL-compatible with branching
- **Neon**: PostgreSQL with autoscaling
- **Railway**: PostgreSQL managed hosting

### File Locations for Implementation
[Source: ProcessPilot-Brownfield-PRD.md#operations-documentation]
**New Files to Create**:
- `docs/OPERATIONS.md` - Database backup/recovery procedures
- `backend/scripts/backup.sh` - Database backup automation scripts
- `backend/scripts/restore.sh` - Recovery procedure scripts
- `docs/DISASTER_RECOVERY.md` - Complete disaster recovery runbook

### Health Monitoring Integration
[Source: architecture.md#monitoring-and-observability]
**Integration Points**:
- **Health Endpoints**: Add backup status to `/health/detailed`
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Include backup completion and file size metrics
- **Winston Logging**: Structured logging for backup operations

### Multi-Provider Backup Strategies
[Source: architecture.md#multi-provider-database-support]
**Provider-Specific Approaches**:
- **PostgreSQL**: pg_dump with compression and scheduling
- **Supabase**: Built-in backup features + manual data export
- **PlanetScale**: Branching-based backup + data export
- **Neon**: Point-in-time recovery + logical backups
- **Railway**: Automated backups + manual procedures

### Production Requirements Context
[Source: ProcessPilot-Brownfield-PRD.md#gap-analysis]
- **Current State**: No documented backup/recovery procedures
- **Impact**: High - critical for production operations
- **Effort**: 2-3 hours to document procedures and create scripts
- **Business Value**: Production operational safety and compliance

### Security and Compliance
[Source: ProcessPilot-Brownfield-PRD.md#risk-assessment]
- **Data Loss Risks**: Currently marked as needing backup/recovery procedures
- **Compliance**: Automated audit trails require backup protection
- **Recovery Time Objectives**: Define RTO/RPO for different scenarios

### Environment Integration
[Source: architecture.md#environment-management]
- **Environment Variables**: Backup storage configuration
- **Production vs Development**: Different backup strategies and retention
- **Multi-Environment**: Backup procedures for dev/staging/prod
