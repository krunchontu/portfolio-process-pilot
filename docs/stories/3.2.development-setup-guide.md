- **Debugging**: Node.js debugging, React DevTools
- **Monitoring**: Health endpoints, Winston logging

### Environment Configuration Requirements
[Source: PROJECT_STATUS.md#environment-setup]
**Environment Variables**:
- JWT secrets (development vs production)
- Database connection strings
- SMTP configuration for email testing
- CORS origins for multi-environment support

### File Locations for Documentation
[Source: TODO_CHECKLIST.md#documentation-section]
**Documentation Files to Create**:
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- `scripts/setup-dev-env.sh` - Automated setup script (Unix)
- `scripts/setup-dev-env.bat` - Automated setup script (Windows)
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions

### Quick Start Requirements
[Source: PROJECT_STATUS.md#how-to-resume-work]
**Essential Setup Steps**:
1. Environment setup with Node.js/npm
2. Database setup with PostgreSQL
3. Repository clone and dependency installation
4. Environment variable configuration
5. Database migration and seeding
6. Development server startup and validation

### IDE and Editor Setup
**Recommended Development Tools**:
- **VS Code**: Extensions for React, Node.js, ESLint, Prettier
- **Debugging**: Node.js debugger configuration
- **Git Integration**: Pre-commit hooks, conventional commits
- **Database Tools**: PostgreSQL client recommendations

### Cross-Platform Considerations
[Source: PROJECT_STATUS.md#cross-platform-development]
**Platform-Specific Requirements**:
- **Windows**: WSL recommendations, PowerShell vs CMD
- **macOS**: Homebrew package management
- **Linux**: Distribution-specific package managers
- **Docker**: Optional containerized development environment

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Assessment Summary:**
Story 3.2 is currently in Draft status with no implementation work completed. This story requires comprehensive development setup documentation and automation scripts to enable efficient developer onboarding.

**Current Status Analysis:**
- **Implementation Status**: ❌ NOT STARTED - All tasks remain incomplete
- **Acceptance Criteria**: ❌ UNMET - No AC requirements have been addressed
- **Documentation**: ❌ MISSING - No setup guide exists for new developers
- **Automation**: ❌ MISSING - No setup scripts available for any platform

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. **Developer Onboarding**: No documented setup process for new team members
2. **Platform Coverage**: Missing setup instructions for Windows/Linux/macOS
3. **Automation**: No scripts to streamline environment configuration
4. **Troubleshooting**: No guidance for common setup issues
5. **Validation**: No procedures to verify successful setup completion

**Recommendation:**
This story should be prioritized for implementation as it directly impacts developer productivity and team scalability. Without proper setup documentation and automation, new team members face significant barriers to contributing effectively.
