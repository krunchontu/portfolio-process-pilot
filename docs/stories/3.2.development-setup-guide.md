## Dev Notes

### Current Development Environment
[Source: TODO_CHECKLIST.md#development-commands-reference]
**Current Setup Process**:
```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd frontend && npm install
npm run db:migrate && npm run db:seed
npm run dev  # Backend port 5000, Frontend port 3000
```

### Platform Compatibility Issues
[Source: PROJECT_STATUS.md#recent-major-changes]
**Known Issues Resolved**:
- Windows development environment issues fixed
- Cross-platform database test utilities implemented
- NODE_ENV problems on Windows resolved

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture.md#local-development-setup]
**Development Architecture**:
- **Backend**: Node.js 18+ with Express on port 5000
- **Frontend**: React/Vite on port 3000  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with test database isolation
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI at http://localhost:5000/docs

### Testing Infrastructure Setup
[Source: TODO_CHECKLIST.md#testing-infrastructure-overhaul]
**Testing Requirements**:
- **Backend**: Jest with 47% coverage, database test utilities
- **Frontend**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **E2E**: Playwright with 140+ scenarios, multi-browser support
- **Database**: Conditional testing with PostgreSQL fallbacks

### Multi-Provider Database Support
[Source: architecture.md#multi-provider-database-support]
**Database Options**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary development database
- **BaaS Providers**: Supabase, PlanetScale, Neon, Railway
- **Configuration**: Environment-based switching via DB_PROVIDER

### Development Tools Integration
[Source: architecture.md#development-and-deployment]
**Development Stack**:
- **Package Manager**: npm with lockfiles and engine specifications
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier pre-configured
- **Debugging**: Node.js debugging, React DevTools
- **Monitoring**: Health endpoints, Winston logging

### Environment Configuration Requirements
[Source: PROJECT_STATUS.md#environment-setup]
**Environment Variables**:
- JWT secrets (development vs production)
- Database connection strings
- SMTP configuration for email testing
- CORS origins for multi-environment support

### File Locations for Documentation
[Source: TODO_CHECKLIST.md#documentation-section]
**Documentation Files to Create**:
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide
- `scripts/setup-dev-env.sh` - Automated setup script (Unix)
- `scripts/setup-dev-env.bat` - Automated setup script (Windows)
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions

### Quick Start Requirements
[Source: PROJECT_STATUS.md#how-to-resume-work]
**Essential Setup Steps**:
1. Environment setup with Node.js/npm
2. Database setup with PostgreSQL
3. Repository clone and dependency installation
4. Environment variable configuration
5. Database migration and seeding
6. Development server startup and validation

### IDE and Editor Setup
**Recommended Development Tools**:
- **VS Code**: Extensions for React, Node.js, ESLint, Prettier
- **Debugging**: Node.js debugger configuration
- **Git Integration**: Pre-commit hooks, conventional commits
- **Database Tools**: PostgreSQL client recommendations

### Cross-Platform Considerations
[Source: PROJECT_STATUS.md#cross-platform-development]
**Platform-Specific Requirements**:
- **Windows**: WSL recommendations, PowerShell vs CMD
- **macOS**: Homebrew package management
- **Linux**: Distribution-specific package managers
- **Docker**: Optional containerized development environment
