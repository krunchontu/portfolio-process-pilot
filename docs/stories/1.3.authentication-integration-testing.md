# Story 1.3: Authentication Integration Testing

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** development team,  
**I want** comprehensive authentication security tests,  
**So that** XSS vulnerabilities are prevented in future changes

## Acceptance Criteria
1. E2E tests verify cookie-only authentication works across all user flows
2. Security tests confirm no localStorage usage in authentication
3. Frontend unit tests updated for new cookie-based auth flow
4. Performance tests verify cookie-based auth doesn't impact response times
5. Regression tests prevent future localStorage token storage

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create comprehensive E2E authentication tests (AC: 1)
  - [x] Test complete login → request creation → logout flow with cookies
  - [x] Test token refresh during long user sessions  
  - [x] Test concurrent user sessions with cookie authentication
  - [x] Test authentication across different request types (leave, expense, equipment)
- [x] Implement security validation tests (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create XSS protection tests that attempt localStorage token access
  - [x] Validate httpOnly cookie attributes (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
  - [x] Test CSRF protection works with cookie authentication
  - [x] Create manual security test scenarios for penetration testing
- [x] Update frontend unit tests (AC: 3)
  - [x] Update AuthContext tests for cookie-based authentication
  - [x] Update api.js tests for axios interceptor cookie handling
  - [x] Update component tests that depend on authentication state
  - [x] Remove any tests that check localStorage for token presence
- [x] Performance testing for cookie authentication (AC: 4)
  - [x] Benchmark API response times with cookie-based auth
  - [x] Test authentication performance under load
  - [x] Validate no performance regression from localStorage migration
- [x] Regression prevention tests (AC: 5)
  - [x] Create linting rules to prevent localStorage token usage
  - [x] Add automated tests that fail if localStorage is used for tokens
  - [x] Update CI/CD pipeline to run security validation tests

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Depends on**: Stories 1.1 and 1.2 must be completed first as this story tests the implemented cookie-based authentication and secure refresh functionality.

### Current Testing Infrastructure
[Source: architecture.md#testing-infrastructure]
- **Backend**: Jest with 47% coverage, includes integration tests with database
- **Frontend**: Vitest + React Testing Library for component tests
- **E2E**: Playwright with 140+ scenarios across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile
- **Security**: Current tests need enhancement for XSS protection validation

### Testing Architecture Context
[Source: architecture.md#testing-reality]
**Test Structure**:
- **Backend Tests**: `backend/tests/` with models, routes, middleware subdirectories
- **Frontend Tests**: `frontend/tests/` with component and integration tests
- **E2E Tests**: `frontend/tests/e2e/` with Playwright configuration
- **Test Database**: Separate `process_pilot_test` with transaction isolation

### Security Testing Requirements
[Source: SECURITY_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md#testing-strategy]
**Security Test Types Needed**:
1. **XSS Protection Tests**: Verify no JavaScript access to tokens
2. **Cookie Security Tests**: Confirm httpOnly, secure, sameSite attributes
3. **Authentication Flow Tests**: End-to-end cookie-based authentication  
4. **Token Refresh Tests**: Secure refresh without localStorage
5. **CSRF Protection Tests**: Verify CSRF tokens work with cookie auth

### File Locations for Test Updates
[Source: architecture.md#source-tree-and-module-organization]
**Test Files to Create/Update**:
- `frontend/tests/e2e/authentication-security.spec.js` - New comprehensive E2E tests
- `frontend/tests/contexts/AuthContext.test.jsx` - Update for cookie-based auth
- `frontend/tests/services/api.test.js` - Update axios interceptor tests
- `backend/tests/routes/auth.test.js` - Add cookie authentication tests
- `backend/tests/middleware/auth.test.js` - Update auth middleware tests

### Performance Testing Context
[Source: ProcessPilot-Brownfield-PRD.md#performance-characteristics]
- **Current Performance**: API response time < 200ms for common operations
- **Target**: Maintain < 200ms response time after cookie authentication
- **Testing Tool**: Existing performance monitoring infrastructure

### CI/CD Integration Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#production-ready-features]
- **Test Commands**: `npm run test:ci` for backend, `npm run test:coverage` for frontend
- **Coverage Target**: Maintain 47% backend coverage, add security test coverage
- **E2E Integration**: `npm run test:e2e` with multi-browser testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.md#running-tests]
**Test Execution Patterns**:
```bash
# Backend security tests
npm test -- --grep "authentication security"
npm run test:integration -- --grep "cookie auth"

# Frontend authentication tests  
npm test AuthContext.test.jsx
npm test api.test.js

# E2E authentication flows
npm run test:e2e -- authentication-security.spec.js
```
