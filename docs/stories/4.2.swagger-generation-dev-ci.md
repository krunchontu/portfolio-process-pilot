# Story 4.2: Wire Swagger Generation into Dev & CI

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer and CI user,
**I want** Swagger JSON to be generated automatically in dev and validated in CI,
**So that** API docs are always up to date and frontend type generation remains reliable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A repeatable command generates `backend/docs/swagger.json` from source annotations/scripts.
2. Local dev flow documents how to regenerate Swagger and serve docs without 404s.
3. CI pipeline updates under `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` run Swagger dump and fail when committed `swagger.json` is stale (diff check).
4. Frontend `npm run api:types` succeeds locally and in CI using the generated `swagger.json`.
5. README (or DEV_SETUP) includes a brief “API Docs & Types” section with commands.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Prerequisites (MUST BE FIRST)**
  - [x] Create `backend/docs/` directory to ensure swagger output path exists
- [x] Backend scripts (AC: 1) - *Dependencies: Prerequisites completed*
  - [x] Verify/update `npm run swagger:json` to output `backend/docs/swagger.json`
  - [x] Ensure script works cross-platform and without network access
- [x] Dev experience (AC: 2, 5)
  - [x] Add docs: how to regenerate (`npm run swagger:json`) and preview (`/docs`, `/api/swagger.json`)
  - [x] Note common pitfalls and location of output file
- [x] CI integration (AC: 3) - *Dependencies: Backend scripts completed*
  - [x] Update `.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml` to run swagger dump after npm install but before tests
  - [x] Add diff check step with exact failure message: `git diff --exit-code backend/docs/swagger.json || (echo "❌ Swagger JSON is stale. Run: npm --prefix backend run swagger:json && git add backend/docs/swagger.json && git commit --amend --no-edit" && exit 1)`
  - [x] Position swagger generation step as step 3 (after checkout and npm install)
- [x] Frontend types (AC: 4) - *Dependencies: Backend scripts completed, swagger.json generated*
  - [x] Confirm `frontend npm run api:types` consumes `../backend/docs/swagger.json`
  - [x] Add CI step in frontend workflow to run `api:types` after backend swagger generation
  - [x] Ensure frontend CI job depends on backend CI completion for swagger.json availability
- [x] Verification (AC: 1–5)
  - [x] Open PR with updated `swagger.json` and CI workflow
  - [x] Ensure FE type generation works locally and in CI

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Project Docs & Scripts
- Swagger dump script exists in backend: `scripts: { "swagger:json": "node src/scripts/dump-swagger.js" }`
- Frontend type generation references `../backend/docs/swagger.json` via `api:types`
- Additions required in CI workflows under `.github/workflows/`

### Architecture & Standards References
- [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- [Source: docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md]

### Technical Considerations
- Keep generated file in repo to simplify FE type generation; enforce freshness in CI.
- Ensure the Swagger source is the single source of truth (annotations/config).

### Testing

#### Unit Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test `npm run swagger:json` command execution and output generation
- [ ] Verify generated `swagger.json` is valid JSON and matches OpenAPI 3.0 schema
- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility (Windows/macOS/Linux)

#### Integration Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test CI pipeline swagger generation and diff check functionality
- [ ] Verify frontend `npm run api:types` works with generated swagger.json
- [ ] Test failure scenarios: stale swagger.json triggers CI failure with correct error message

#### End-to-End Testing Requirements
- [ ] Full workflow test: code change → swagger generation → CI validation → frontend type generation
- [ ] Test developer workflow: local swagger regeneration → commit → CI passes
- [ ] Verify API documentation accessibility at `/docs` endpoint after swagger generation

#### Error Scenarios to Test
- [ ] Missing `backend/docs/` directory (should be created automatically)
- [ ] Invalid swagger annotations causing generation failure
- [ ] Network connectivity issues during CI (ensure offline generation)
- [ ] Permission issues with file creation in CI environment

## Epic Reference
**Source Epic**: Standalone story - part of development tooling improvement initiative
**Epic Context**: Automate API documentation and type generation to improve developer experience and prevent documentation drift
