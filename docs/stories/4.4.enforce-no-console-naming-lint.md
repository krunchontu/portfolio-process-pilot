# Story 4.4: Enforce no-console and Naming via Lint

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** team focused on quality,
**I want** lint rules that prevent console noise and enforce naming conventions,
**So that** code remains consistent and production logs are clean.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ESLint `no-console` enforced: error in CI; locally warn or allow for tests/scripts.
2. Naming convention rule(s) configured and applied across FE/BE (use `camelcase` for JS or `@typescript-eslint/naming-convention` where TS is enabled).
3. Allowlist for `scripts/`, migration/seed files, and tests where console output is acceptable.
4. Pre-commit hook runs lint and blocks violations; CI fails on lint errors.
5. Docs updated to explain the policy, exceptions, and how to fix violations.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Lint configuration updates (AC: 1-3)
  - [ ] Backend: update `.eslintrc.js` to enable `no-console` and naming rules with folder-based overrides (allow in `backend/scripts/**`, `backend/src/database/**`, `backend/setup.js`)
  - [ ] Frontend: update `.eslintrc.cjs` (and security rules if needed) similarly (allow in `frontend/tests/**` and tooling scripts)
- [ ] Hooks & CI (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Wire `.githooks/pre-commit` to run lint (ensure `core.hooksPath` documented)
  - [ ] Ensure GitHub Actions run lint and fail on errors
- [ ] Documentation (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add a short section to README or `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md#validation--verification` about lint policies
  - [ ] Note exceptions for setup/migrations/tests
- [ ] Verification (AC: 1â€“5)
  - [ ] Introduce a deliberate console error in a throwaway branch to confirm CI blocks it
  - [ ] Remove test artifact and ensure green pipeline

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Project Files
- Backend: `backend/.eslintrc.js`, existing logger usage
- Frontend: `frontend/.eslintrc.cjs`, `frontend/.eslintrc.security.js`
- Git hook: `.githooks/pre-commit`

### Architecture & Standards References
- [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- [Source: docs/NAMING-CONVENTIONS.md]

### Technical Considerations
- Keep console allowed in setup/migrations/CLI where output is expected.
- Use directory overrides in ESLint configs to scope exceptions.
