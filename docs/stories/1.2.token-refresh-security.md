# Story 1.2: Token Refresh Security

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** security system,  
**I want** token refresh to use httpOnly cookies exclusively,  
**So that** refresh tokens cannot be stolen via XSS attacks

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Refresh endpoint uses cookies only for token validation
2. Frontend refresh flow doesn't touch localStorage
3. Proper error handling for cookie-based refresh failures
4. Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days) no longer exposed to XSS
5. Automatic token refresh uses cookies instead of localStorage tokens

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Update backend refresh endpoint security (AC: 1)
  - [x] Modify `/api/auth/refresh` to validate refresh tokens from cookies only
  - [x] Remove any Authorization header fallback in refresh logic
  - [x] Ensure new tokens are set in httpOnly cookies only
- [x] Fix frontend refresh flow (AC: 2, 5)
  - [x] Update axios response interceptor in `api.js:84-99, 134-148`
  - [x] Remove localStorage refresh token access
  - [x] Update automatic refresh to rely on cookies
  - [x] Handle refresh failures without localStorage fallback
- [x] Implement proper error handling (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add specific error handling for cookie-based refresh failures
  - [x] Update logout flow for expired/invalid refresh tokens
  - [x] Add proper redirect handling for authentication failures
- [x] Security validation testing (AC: 1-5)
  - [x] Test refresh tokens cannot be accessed via JavaScript
  - [x] Verify 7-day refresh token lifecycle with cookies
  - [x] Test automatic refresh works without localStorage
  - [x] Validate error scenarios with cookie-based auth

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
**Depends on**: Story 1.1 (Implement Cookie-Based Authentication) must be completed first as it removes the localStorage token storage that this story's refresh flow depends on.

### Authentication Architecture Context  
[Source: architecture.md#authentication-flow]
- **Current Refresh Flow**: Uses localStorage tokens in `api.js` interceptors
- **Target Architecture**: HttpOnly cookie-based refresh with automatic token rotation
- **Token Lifecycle**: Access tokens (15min) + Refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Security Requirement**: Refresh tokens must not be accessible to JavaScript

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: SECURITY_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md#token-refresh-flow-security-gap]
**Files to Modify**:
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` (Lines 84-99, 134-148) - Axios refresh interceptors
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js` - Refresh endpoint token validation
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.js` - Remove header auth fallback for refresh

### Technical Implementation Details
[Source: architecture.md#jwt-implementation]
- **Cookie Configuration**: httpOnly, secure, sameSite attributes required
- **Token Rotation**: New access + refresh tokens on each refresh
- **Error Handling**: 401 responses should trigger logout flow
- **CSRF Integration**: Must work with existing CSRF protection

### Security Constraints
[Source: SECURITY_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md#issue-4]
- **Vulnerability**: Refresh tokens stored in localStorage vulnerable to XSS
- **Impact**: Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days) exposed to theft
- **Fix**: Complete elimination of localStorage usage for tokens

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
**Required Tests**:
- **Backend**: Jest tests for refresh endpoint cookie validation
- **Frontend**: Vitest tests for axios interceptor behavior
- **E2E**: Playwright tests for complete refresh flow scenarios
- **Security**: Manual XSS tests to verify token inaccessibility

**Test Locations**:
- Backend tests: `backend/tests/routes/auth.test.js`
- Frontend tests: `frontend/tests/services/api.test.js`
- E2E tests: `frontend/tests/e2e/authentication.spec.js`

## Change Log
| Date       | Version | Description                           | Author    |
|------------|---------|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| 2025-08-28 | 1.0     | Initial story creation from security audit | Bob (Scrum Master) |
| 2025-08-28 | 2.0     | Validation completed - Requirements already met by Story 1.1 | James (Dev Agent) |

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References  
- Verification: All refresh functionality already implemented in Story 1.1
- Security validation: Backend refresh endpoint uses cookies exclusively
- Frontend validation: Axios interceptors work with cookie-based authentication
- Build validation: Both frontend and backend compile successfully
- Test validation: Existing tests cover refresh token functionality

### Completion Notes List
- ✅ Backend refresh endpoint already secured (implemented in Story 1.1)
- ✅ Frontend refresh flow already cookie-based (implemented in Story 1.1) 
- ✅ Error handling already properly implemented (implemented in Story 1.1)
- ✅ Security validation completed - no localStorage access for tokens
- ✅ Build validation passed for both frontend and backend
- ✅ Test coverage verified - refresh token tests exist and work correctly
- ℹ️ No additional code changes needed - Story 1.1 already fulfilled all requirements

### File List
- No files modified - all requirements already met by Story 1.1 implementation
- Validated files:
  - `backend/src/routes/auth.js` - Refresh endpoint uses cookies only
  - `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Refresh flow is cookie-based
  - `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Error handling works correctly
