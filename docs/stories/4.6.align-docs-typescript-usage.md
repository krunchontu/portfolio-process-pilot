# Story 4.6: Align Docs With Actual TypeScript Usage

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** contributor onboarding to the project,
**I want** the documentation to accurately reflect TypeScript usage in the repo,
**So that** expectations match reality and setup/testing instructions are clear.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. README and `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` accurately describe current status: React code is primarily JS/JSX with TypeScript infra present (tsconfig, type generation) and limited TS usage.
2. `frontend` docs clearly state how and when to run `npm run api:types` and where generated types live (`src/types/api.d.ts`). Include an example line showing: "Generated: frontend/src/types/api.d.ts".
3. `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` reflects JS-first UI with scoped TS (type gen and future migration), avoiding overclaiming TS adoption.
4. Optional TS migration plan is documented briefly (scope and sequencing), without committing to timelines.
5. No broken claims remain in README/tech stack about full TS conversion.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Update README (AC: 1, 2, 5)
  - [ ] Clarify JS-first with TS infra and generated API types
  - [ ] Add a short "Types" subsection linking to `api:types` command and file path (include the example output line)
- [ ] Update `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Add an explicit step to run `frontend npm run api:types` after backend swagger dump
  - [ ] Note where the types are generated and how to re-run
- [ ] Update `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Adjust the "Frontend Stack" narrative to JS-first + typed API models
  - [ ] Remove or soften language that implies full TS across components
- [ ] Optional: Add `docs/architecture/frontend-migration-checklist.md` pointer (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Brief plan: prioritize types for API models and utility modules first
- [ ] Verification (AC: 1â€“5)
  - [ ] Review all doc references to TS to ensure consistency and accuracy
